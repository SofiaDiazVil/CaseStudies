# CaseStudies
In this repository you can find the code and data used for our Case Studies project. Using the elements available in this repository you can replicate our results.

Here below you can find a description of what each script is for as well as what information is included in each data file 
- DDM Basic.py : simplest version of the DDM model. It only calculates the drift rate, noise, boundary and non-decision time. This is the code used for the results in the paper. 
- DDM congruency.py : DDM model that calculates the same as the Basic version, but additionally it als estimates a different drift rate and non decision time for the congruent and incongruent trials. This code was never run, it was rather made as an exercice. 
- DDM Variance.py : DDM model that calculates the same as the Basic version, but additionally it also estimates the variance of the drift rate and non-decision time. This code wasn't used since  it takes a longer time to run and the variance was not necessary for our hypotheses.
